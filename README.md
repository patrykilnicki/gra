# 10x Astro Starter

![](./public/template.png)

A modern, opinionated starter template for building fast, accessible web applications.

## Tech Stack

- [Astro](https://astro.build/) v7 - Modern web framework with server-first rendering
- [React](https://react.dev/) v19 - UI library for interactive components
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) v6 - Type-safe JavaScript
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) v4 - Utility-first CSS framework
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) - Authentication and backend-as-a-service
- [Render](https://render.com/) - Always-on Node web service (`@astrojs/node` standalone)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v22.14.0 (as specified in `.nvmrc`)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/przeprogramowani/10x-astro-starter.git
cd 10x-astro-starter
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up Supabase and configure environment variables — see [Supabase Configuration](#supabase-configuration) below.

4. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server (`astro dev`)
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm start` - Run the production Node server (`dist/server/entry.mjs`); reads `HOST`, `PORT` and the Supabase variables from the environment
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint with type-checked rules
- `npm run lint:fix` - Auto-fix ESLint issues
- `npm run format` - Run Prettier
- `npm run smoke` - Smoke test the auth flow against a running server (`BASE_URL`, defaults to `http://localhost:4321`)

## Supabase Configuration

This project uses [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) for authentication. Environment variables are declared via Astro's `astro:env` schema and are treated as **server-only secrets** — they are never exposed to the client.

### First-time setup (local, no cloud project needed)

Requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and ~7 GB RAM.

1. Create your `.env` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Initialize the local Supabase project (creates a `supabase/` config folder):

```bash
npx supabase init
```

3. Start the local stack (downloads Docker images on first run):

```bash
npx supabase start
```

4. Copy the credentials printed by the CLI into your `.env`:

```
SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54321
SUPABASE_KEY=<anon key from CLI output>
```

5. To stop the stack when done:

```bash
npx supabase stop
```

The local Studio UI is available at `http://localhost:54323`.

No database tables or migrations are required — this project uses Supabase Auth's built-in `auth.users` table only.

### Using a cloud Supabase project instead

If you prefer to use a hosted Supabase project, add these variables to your `.env` file:

| Variable       | Description                                                |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Project URL from Supabase dashboard → Settings → API       |
| `SUPABASE_KEY` | `anon` public key from Supabase dashboard → Settings → API |

```
SUPABASE_URL=https://<project-ref>.supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=<anon-key>
```

### Email confirmation in local development

By default Supabase requires email confirmation before a user can sign in. To skip this during local development:

1. Open the Supabase dashboard for your project
2. Go to **Authentication → Email → Confirm email**
3. Toggle it **off**

Users can then sign in immediately after sign-up without clicking a confirmation link.

### Auth routes

| Route                 | Description                                                             |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/auth/signin`        | Email/password sign-in form                                             |
| `/auth/signup`        | Email/password sign-up form                                             |
| `/auth/confirm-email` | Post-signup "check your inbox" page                                     |
| `/dashboard`          | Example protected page (redirects to `/auth/signin` if unauthenticated) |

Route protection is handled in `src/middleware.ts`. Add paths to the `PROTECTED_ROUTES` array there to require authentication.

## Deployment

This project deploys to a paid [Render](https://render.com/) web service in Frankfurt, configured by `render.yaml`. The game needs a process that stays up between requests, so never use the Free instance (it sleeps after ~15 minutes idle). See `context/foundation/infrastructure.md` for the reasoning and risk register.

1. Prove the production server locally:

```bash
npm run build
HOST=0.0.0.0 PORT=10000 node --env-file=.env ./dist/server/entry.mjs
```

2. In the Render dashboard choose **New → Blueprint**, point it at this repo, confirm region `frankfurt` and plan `starter`, and enter `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY`.
3. Do not set `NODE_VERSION`; Render then picks 22.14.0 from `.nvmrc`. Confirm that version in the first deploy log.
4. Run the smoke test against the live URL: `BASE_URL=https://<service>.onrender.com npm run smoke`.

Pushes to `master` autodeploy. Runtime logs: `render logs -r SERVICE_ID --tail`. Rollback is a dashboard action (service → Deploys) and turns autodeploy off until you re-enable it; Supabase migrations do not roll back with it, so keep them additive.

## Smoke test

`scripts/smoke.mjs` is a dependency-free Node script that walks the whole auth flow (sign-up, sign-in, protected page, sign-out) over HTTP. Run it against the dev server or the production preview after dependency upgrades:

```bash
npm run dev            # or: npm run build && PORT=4321 node --env-file=.env ./dist/server/entry.mjs
BASE_URL=http://localhost:4321 npm run smoke
```

It needs a reachable Supabase instance (local or cloud) with email confirmation disabled.

> **Note:** this script exists primarily to guard the development of the starter itself — it is a fast sanity check that dependency upgrades did not break the build, the Node adapter or the Supabase auth flow. It is **not** a substitute for a real test suite. Once you build your own product on top of this starter, add proper tests (unit, integration, end-to-end) suited to your application.

## CI

GitHub Actions runs two jobs on every push and PR to `master`:

- **ci** — lint, `astro check` and build. Configure `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` as repository secrets for the build step.
- **smoke** — starts a local Supabase via the Supabase CLI, builds, starts the production Node server (`npm start`) and runs `npm run smoke` against it. No secrets required.
